In all of these scenarios, it describes the dynamics of wave envelopes in the presence of dispersion and weak nonlinearity. A natural question is to understand if it is possible to write the equation regardless of the physical details, starting from a purely mathematical assumptions on the evolution of the fields. This is illuminating from the mathematical point of view, besides being an useful exercise.\nIn this post we explore a method to derive the NLSE in general, starting from a generic partial differential equation and assuming properties of the evolution operator.\nLet us condiser a partial differential equation in $d$ dimensions for a scalar field $u$, $$ L(\\partial_t, \\nabla)u = G(u), $$ where $L$ is a linear operator, and $G$ a generic (nonlinear) function of $u$ and its derivatives. For low-amplitude solutions, the nonlienar term can be neglected, so solutions are $$ u = \\epsilon\\psi \\exp[i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t)], $$ with $\\omega$ and $\\mathbf{k}$ linked by the dispersion relation $$ L(-i\\omega, i\\mathbf{k}) = 0. $$ in general, this relation admits a number of solutions $\\omega$ given a fixed $\\mathbf{k}$. Let $\\omega(\\mathbf{k})$ be one of those solutions. Considering the solution in Eq. (\\ref{solution}), the dispersion relation can be written as $$ [i\\partial_t - \\omega(i\\partial_{\\mathbf{r}})] \\ \\epsilon\\psi\\exp[i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t)], $$ by promoting $\\omega$ to an operator. We now introduce a correction: for small nonlinearity, the angular frequency will depend on $\\epsilon^2 |\\psi|^2$. Therefore we substitute $\\omega(\\mathbf{k})$ with $\\Omega(\\mathbf{k}, \\epsilon^2|\\psi|^2)$. Notice that $\\Omega(\\mathbf{k}, 0)=\\omega(\\mathbf{k})$. Moreover, the amplitude $\\psi$ becomes dependent on the slow variables $T=\\epsilon t$ and $\\mathbf{X} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{x}$. We can formally substitute $\\partial_t \\longrightarrow \\partial_t + \\epsilon\\partial_T$ and $\\partial_{\\mathbf{x}} \\longrightarrow \\partial_{x}+\\epsilon \\nabla$, where $\\nabla$ is the gradient with respect to the slow variable. The dispersion relation Eq. (\\ref{dispersion}) becomes\n$$ [i\\omega + \\epsilon \\partial_T - \\Omega(\\mathbf{k}-i\\epsilon\\nabla, \\epsilon^2|\\psi|^2)]\\psi = 0. $$\nSince $\\epsilon$ is considered small, we can expand the equation in power series around $\\epsilon=0$, writing\n$$ i(\\partial_T + \\mathbf{v}_g \\cdot \\nabla)\\psi + \\epsilon[\\nabla \\cdot (D\\nabla\\psi) + \\gamma|\\psi|^2\\psi]=0 $$\nwhere $ \\mathbf{v}_g=\\nabla\\mathbf{k} \\omega $ is the group velocity, and $D$ the half Hessian matrix of $\\omega$. Furthermore, by scaling the spatial coordinate $\\mathbf{\\zeta} = \\mathbf{X} - T\\mathbf{v}_g$, and $\\tau = \\epsilon T$, we obtain\n$$ i\\partial_\\tau +\\nabla \\cdot (D\\nabla\\psi) + \\gamma |\\psi|^2 \\psi = 0 $$\nthat is exactly the NLSE in a generic medium. In isotropic media, $ \\nabla \\cdot (D\\nabla) = \\nabla^2 $ .\n"}]
