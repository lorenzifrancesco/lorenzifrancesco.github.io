      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a passionate Ph.D. student of Theoretical Physics of Matter, at the department of Physics and Astronomy of University of Padova. I have background in optics and photonics for telecommunications.
My current research interests are in theoretical physics of matter:
solitons and their stability in classical and quantum field theories highly nonlinear phenomena in Bose-Einstein condensates, Josephson oscillations Due to my background in photonic engineering and ICT, I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in</description>
