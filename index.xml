      <description>In this posts I will review the various calculations one can perform to derive the result of Bose-Einstein condensation for a ideal and a weakly interacting Bose gas. These derivations are useful for their mathematical content and to show the relevant physical variables that are meaningful in this context.</description>

      <description>This is a classical calculation in Poisson processes, indicating how to obtain a binomial variable from two Poisson processes.
Let $X_1(t) \sim \mathcal{P}(\lambda_1 t)$ and $X_2(t) \sim \mathcal{P}(\lambda_2 t)$ be two independent Poisson processes, with parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ respectively, that can be interpreted as averave arrivals in a second. Let us consider the following conditional $$ \begin{align} &amp;amp; P[X_1(t)=k \ | \ X_1(t)+X_2(t) &amp;amp;= n+k] \end{align} $$ that is the probability that there are $k$ arrivals from the variable 1, conditioned on the number of total arrivals being $n+k$.</description>

      <description>Based on Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 53, 2123 (1967)
Consider an electromagnetic field in a laser cavity with a mirror moving with velocity $v=\beta c$. Suppose to neglect polarization. So the transverse field $E(x, t)$ satisfy boundary conditions $$ E(0, t) = 0 $$ and, in the transformed reference frame $$ E(L_0 + vt, t) - \beta H(L_0+vt, t) = 0 $$ We seek solutions as superposition of plane waves, so we have</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a passionate Ph.D. student of Theoretical Physics of Matter, at the department of Physics and Astronomy of University of Padova. I have background in optics and photonics for telecommunications.
My current research interests are in theoretical physics of matter:
solitons and their stability in classical and quantum field theories highly nonlinear phenomena in Bose-Einstein condensates, Josephson oscillations Due to my background in photonic engineering and ICT, I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in</description>

      <description>Nonlinear Schrödinger equations appears in numerous physical setups, like nonlinear optics, condensed matter physics and plasma physics. In all of these scenarios, it describes the dynamics of wave envelopes in the presence of dispersion and weak nonlinearity. A natural question is to understand if it is possible to write the equation regardless of the physical details, starting from a purely mathematical assumptions on the evolution of the fields. This is illuminating from the mathematical point of view, besides being an useful exercise.</description>
